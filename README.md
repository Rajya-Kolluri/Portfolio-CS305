# Portfolio-CS305
# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is the client, a consulting company specializing in individualized financial plans. They wanted to modernize their operations and ensure the security of their web-based software application.
# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I conducted a thorough manual review and used static testing to identify vulnerabilities in the client's software. Coding securely is important because it helps protect sensitive data, maintain user trust, and prevent potential financial and reputational losses for the company.
# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was ensuring that all potential vulnerabilities were identified and providing effective mitigation strategies. It was helpful to have a clear process to follow.
# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by both manually reviewing the code and using static testing tools like the dependency-check plug-in. In the future, I would consider using automated security scanning tools for a more comprehensive assessment.
# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure the code and software application were functional and secure, I performed extensive testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. After refactoring, I conducted regression testing to check for new vulnerabilities.
# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used the Maven Dependency-Check plug-in for static testing, which can be helpful for identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities. This practice of integrating security tools into the development pipeline can be valuable for future tasks.
# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
In future job applications, I can showcase the vulnerability assessment report I created, demonstrating my ability to identify security vulnerabilities and propose mitigation strategies. This report serves as evidence of my skills, knowledge, and experience in software security analysis and secure coding practices.
